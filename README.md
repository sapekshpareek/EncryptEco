# Creating Encryption Techniques Using Python

This Python project aims to implement encryption techniques, including AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), to enhance storage efficiency. The project includes functionalities for both encryption and decryption, with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and reliability.

## How It Works

The project provides a Python script `main.py` that serves as the entry point for running the encryption and decryption functionalities. The script utilizes the encryption techniques implemented in the project to process input data and produce encrypted or decrypted output.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the project requires certain dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

```
git clone http://github.com/sapekshpareek/Minor-2
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd Minor-2
```

3. Install the required dependencies using the command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the `main.py` script using Python:

```
python main.py
```

This will execute the encryption and decryption functionalities of the project, allowing you to encrypt or decrypt data as needed.

**Note: Copy & Save The Generated Key at Encryption, it will required for Decryption.**
